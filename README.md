# CodeChef Repository

This repository contains my solutions to CodeChef problems as I progress towards achieving 5-star status.

## Directory Structure

- **CodeChef_1_star**: Solutions to CodeChef problems categorized under 1-star difficulty.
- **CodeChef_2_star**: Solutions to CodeChef problems categorized under 2-star difficulty.
- **CodeChef_3_star**: Solutions to CodeChef problems categorized under 3-star difficulty.
- **CodeChef_4_star**: Solutions to CodeChef problems categorized under 4-star difficulty.
- **CodeChef_5_star**: Solutions to CodeChef problems categorized under 5-star difficulty.

Each directory contains:
- **Problem Name**: Each solution is named after the CodeChef problem code.
  - `problem_code.cpp` 
  - `README.md`: Description and approach to solve the problem.

## How to Use

You can navigate through the directories based on the star ratings to find the problems and their solutions. Each solution directory (`CodeChef_X_star`) contains a README.md file with a detailed explanation of the problem and my approach to solving it.
